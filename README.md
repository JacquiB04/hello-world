For sharing ideas.

Hello there! My name is Jacqui and I am an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Portland. I first learned
about computer science in my high school "Principles of Engineering" course. I love typing, programming, designing, and sharing
ideas with others. This is what this repository is all about.
